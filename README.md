## Supersingular Fixed Degree Isogeny Path (SIPFD) problem

This repository includes:

- A C-code CPU implementation of the MitM and vOW algorithms for solving the SIPFD problem. The implementation is based on short Weierstrass and Montgomery curves with x-only projective coordinates
and can be used to find láµ‰-isogenies between two supersingular elliptic curves (both given in short Weierstrass form), where l=2,3.

- An optimized GPU implementation of the vOW attack.

Compilation and execution instructions for both architectures are provided in the respective subdirectories.
